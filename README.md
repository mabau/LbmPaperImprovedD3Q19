Overview
--------

This repository contains additional material for the Paper 
"An improved lattice Boltzmann D3Q19 method based on an alternative equilibrium discretization".
This additional material contains Python files where the newly proposed method is 
derived using the computer algebra system *sympy*.


View without installation
-------------------------

You can view the additional material directly by opening one of the`AdditionalMaterial*.html` files in your browser.


Interactive View
----------------

To open the Jupyter notebooks interactively, you need a Python3 environment with `sympy`, `matplotlib` and `Jupyter` installed.
An easy way to set up a working environment is via the [Conda Package Manager](https://conda.io/miniconda.html).
